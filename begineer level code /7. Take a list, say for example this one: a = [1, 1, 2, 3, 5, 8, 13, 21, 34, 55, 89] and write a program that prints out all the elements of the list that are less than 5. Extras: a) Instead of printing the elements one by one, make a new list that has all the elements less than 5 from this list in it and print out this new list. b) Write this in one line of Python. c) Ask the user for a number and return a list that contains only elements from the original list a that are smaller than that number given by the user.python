#(a) Make a new list with all elements < 5
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

new_list = []

for x in a:
    if x < 5:
        new_list.append(x)

print(new_list)

#(b) One-line Python solution
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
print([x for x in a if x < 5])

#(c) Ask user for a number and print elements < that number
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

result = [x for x in a if x < num]

print(result)
